1. Syntax Highlighintng - Python iterprepter will scan line by line then apply different color coding to the fucntion / variables / text /loops.
2. Python will keep track of latest value of the variables. 
3. Variable names can not start with number . It can't have space in it.
4. Variables are often described as boxes you can store your value in . However programaticlly variables are labels assigned to the values.
5.

"""
Strings :
1. A string is series of characters . Anything inside quotes is cosidered strings in python . You can use both [ ' ' or " "].
2. A methon is an action that python can perform on the piece of data. 
3. name.title() -: title is an Action . '.' is telling python interpreter to callaction on name .
4. Each method is followed by set of parathesis because methods genrally requires  additional inforamtion to perform their work. [title()]
5. f-strings : formatted strings 
6. In programming - Whitespace refers to any non printing characters . Such as spaces, tabs , end of line symbols .
7. rstrip() , lstrip() , strip() functions

"""
Integers :
    + , - , * , / , // , ** 
    Supports order of opertions however you can change the order using parathesis .

Float :
    Number with decimal point . 

Under Score in Numbers :
    When you're woring the long numbers you can use _ to group digits.
    nums = 14_000_000_000
    print(nums) # 14000000000

Constants 
    Python does not have built in type for constants . However as good practise variable name all in caps is considered as constant.
    MAX_NUMBER = 5000

"""
List:

    A list is collection of items in a particular order.
    Since list mostly contains more than one element . It is good practise to name it plurals .  items , names .

Accessing a list :
    Using a index , starts with 0 []
    You can use the -ve index . -1 represents the last element .

Modifying , Adding and Removing Elements :
    Modifying -> Same as accessing the element
    
    Adding 
        At the end using the append function . motorcycles.append('ducati')
        At any location we can do using . motorcycles.insert(0,'hero') . This will shift all the elements to the right .

    Remove
        Using Index : del motorcycles[1] 
        
        Using pop method : This will remove the last element form the list 
            popped_motorcycles = motorcycles.pop()
            We can use index with pop to remove the items from the list.
        
        Remove using the value :
            motorcycles.remove('ducati')
            Gives error if element is not present in the list .
            Also removes only the first occurance of the element.
    
    Sorting the List :
        Using sort :
            guests.sort()
            guest.sort(reverse=Ture)
            Sorts the original list permanently

        Using Sorted :
            sorted(guests)
            Does not change the order of the orginal list
            sorted(cars)
            sorted(cars ,reverse=True)


"""

"""
Iterating List :
    Using for loop 

Looping is imporatant because it's one of the most common ways a compoter automates repetetive tasks.

Indendetion will decide , how code blocks will be clubbed together . 

The colon at the end of for statement tells Python to interpret the next line as the start of loop. 

range function : 
    range(start_sequence, end_sequence,step_size)
    Defaults : step - 1, start_sequence - 0 
    range(1,5) - 1,2,3,4
    range(6)   - 0,1,2,3,4,5
    numbers = list(range(1,7))

min(digits),max(digits),sum(digits)
