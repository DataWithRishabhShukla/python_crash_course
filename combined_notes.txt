2. Python will keep track of latest value of the variables. 
3. Variable names can not start with number . It can't have space in it.
4. Variables are often described as boxes you can store your value in . However programaticlly variables are labels assigned to the values.

Strings :
1. A string is series of characters . Anything inside quotes is cosidered strings in python . You can use both [ ' ' or " "].
2. A methon is an action that python can perform on the piece of data. 
3. name.title() -: title is an Action . '.' is telling python interpreter to callaction on name .
4. Each method is followed by set of parathesis because methods genrally requires  additional inforamtion to perform their work. [title()]

List:

    A list is collection of items in a particular order.
    Since list mostly contains more than one element . It is good practise to name it plurals .  items , names .

Accessing a list :
    Using a index , starts with 0 []
    You can use the -ve index . -1 represents the last element .

Modifying , Adding and Removing Elements :
    Modifying -> Same as accessing the element
    
    Adding 
        At the end using the append function . motorcycles.append('ducati')
        At any location we can do using . motorcycles.insert(0,'hero') . This will shift all the elements to the right .

    Remove
        Using Index : del motorcycles[1] 
        
        Using pop method : This will remove the last element form the list 
            popped_motorcycles = motorcycles.pop()
            We can use index with pop to remove the items from the list.
        
        Remove using the value :
            motorcycles.remove('ducati')
            Gives error if element is not present in the list .
            Also removes only the first occurance of the element.
    
    Sorting the List :
        Using sort :
            guests.sort()
            guest.sort(reverse=Ture)
            Sorts the original list permanently

        Using Sorted :
            sorted(guests)
            Does not change the order of the orginal list
            sorted(cars)
            sorted(cars ,reverse=True)

"""
Iterating List :
    Using for loop 

Looping is imporatant because it's one of the most common ways a compoter automates repetetive tasks.

Indendetion will decide , how code blocks will be clubbed together . 

The colon at the end of for statement tells Python to interpret the next line as the start of loop. 

range function : 
    range(start_sequence, end_sequence,step_size)
    Defaults : step - 1, start_sequence - 0 
    range(1,5) - 1,2,3,4
    range(6)   - 0,1,2,3,4,5

"""
    '==' tests the condition in case sensitive manner

Checking Multiple condition :
    You can se use 'and' and 'or' for combining the conditions .

Types of if statements 
    - simple if statement

            print('You')

    - if else statment 
    - if-elif-else chain ->  Mutilple if statements 
    - if-elif chain -> You can omit else block in the if-elif chain 

    - In the if-elif chain if once codition is true , it will omit the evalution of remaining conditions .
    - If multiple if can be true then better to go with series of muiltple if statement .

Chapter - 6 - Dictionary 

"""
Dictionary 
    - allows you connect pieces of related information .
    - Nesting 
        - dictionary inside a list 
        - list inside a dictionary
        - dictionary inside a dictionary 

Python dictionary 
    - a dictionary in python is collection of key-value pairs 
    - each key is connected to a value . you can use key to access the value .
    - a key's value can be string, number , list , or another dictionary 
    - you can use any object that you can create in python as a value in dictionary 
    - every key is associated to value by ':' 
    - individual key-value pairs are seperated by ','

Accessing Value in a dictioanary 
    - dictionary_name[<key_name>]

Adding New key-value Pairs 
    - dictionary are dynamic structures 
    - you can add new key value pairs at any time 
    - dictionary  with new_key name wrapped in square brackets along with new value 

Creating empty dictionary 
    - <dictionary_name> = {}

Modifying value in the dictionary 
    - alien_0['color'] = 'green'

Removing a key-value pairs 
    - del alien_0['color']

using get to to access the dictionary element
    - alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'speed':'slow'}
    - print(alien_0['x_pos']) # Throws key-error
    - print(alien_0.get('x_pos','This key does not exist !'))
    - If you don't define the mesage it will return None .

Looping through dictionary :
    - dict.items()
    - dict.keys()  is default behaviour . 
IMP      - [for key in dict.keys()] is same as [for key in dict] 
    - dict.values()
    - looping in an order 
        - sorted(dict.keys())
        - for name in sorted(favorite_laguage):

list -> []
tuple -> ()
dictianary -> {}
set -> {}

set 
    - can be defined using {}
    - contains only unique value 
    - you use set() function also to creare set 
    - Unlike list and dictionaries , sets do not maintain element in specific order 
    - Both dictiaries and sets use {} ,
        - if it has key-value then dictionary .
        - If it has only values then sets

"""
Nesting of dictionary:
    - mutilple dictionary in a list

List of dictionary 
    [{'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}, {'color': 'green', 'points': 5, 'speed': 'slow'}]

List in dictionary 
    - you can nest list inside a dictionary when you more than value to be associated with a key.
