Chapter 8 - Functions

Styling Functions 
    - Functions should have descriptive names and these names should use lowercase letter and underscore
    - Module names should use these convetions as well
    - Every function should have a comment in doc string format  """ """
    - Comment should appear immediately after the function defnition 
    - If you specify a default for a parameter no space should be used on either side of equal sign 
        def function_name(param_0, param_1='default_value')
    - The same convention should be used for keyword argument in function call 
        function_name(value_0, param_1='value')
    - all import should come at the begining only thing allowed before it is comments
    - If module has more than one function it should have two blank lines between function 
    definitions.
